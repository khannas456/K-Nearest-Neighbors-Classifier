# K-Nearest Neighbours
The concept of the k-nearest neighbor classifier can hardly be simpler described. This is an old saying, which can be found in many languages and many cultures. 

This means that the concept of the k-nearest neighbor classifier is part of our everyday life and judging: Imagine you meet a group of people, they are all very young, stylish and sportive. They talk about there friend Ben, who isn't with them. So, what is your imagination of Ben? Right, you imagine him as being yong, stylish and sportive as well. If you learn that Ben lives in a neighborhood where people vote conservative and that the average income is above 200000 dollars a year? Both his neighbors make even more than 300,000 dollars per year? What do you think of Ben? Most probably, you do not consider him to be an underdog and you may suspect him to be a conservative as well?

The principle behind nearest neighbor classification consists in finding a predefined number, i.e. the 'k' - of training samples closest in distance to a new sample, which has to be classified.

Here I have tried to experiment with three different approaches:

1- Classifying Coins based on radius and weight
2-
